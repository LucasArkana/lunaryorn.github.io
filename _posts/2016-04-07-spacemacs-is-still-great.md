excerpt: Don’t worry folks, Spacemacs is still a great thing!

Last week I went back to my own personal Emacs configuration after using
Spacemacs for more than six months.  When I [tweeted][] about it the reaction
absolutely caught me by surprise: Several people asked why and some were even
concerned whether they should still be using Spacemacs now that I left.

I’ll not speak about the reasons why I left Spacemacs, not now, at least.  These
are personal, and more concerned with the community than with the product.

So rest assured, I still think that Spacemacs is a great thing.  All of what
[I said before about Spacemacs]({% post_url 2016-01-26-why-spacemacs %}) still
stands: It’s beautiful, it’s well designed, and it’s a great Emacs distribution.
I can’t unanimously recommend it anymore, and I won’t, but make your own choice!
You make no mistake when you pick Spacemacs.

I’m thankful for the work done in Spacemacs, and I admire the product that it
created and the elegance of its design.  I learned a lot about Emacs while using
Spacemacs, and took a thing or two over to my new configuration.  Spacemacs has
changed the way I bind keys and how I care about discoverability and
documentation in my own editor.

But ultimately, I’m happy to be back at my own configuration.  It feels like
being back home after a long, long holiday in a far, far away place :)
