title: Going Spacemacs
---

In the last few months I was slowly gravitating towards Spacemacs, and about a
month ago I finally couldn’t resist its gravitational pull anymore.  I abandoned
my hand-made, beautiful, elaborate, 3k lines personal Emacs configuration in
favour of Spacemacs, and I’m now going to tell you how that feels.

NOTES:

- Wasn’t smooth, did multiple starts
- layer system hard to get from start up
- Attracted not by Vim bindings, layers, whatnot, but by the “product” and the
  UI

What’s great:

- The “product”
- Embracing VIM
- The layer system
- The community

What’s not so cool:

- Mixed quality… some layers definitely need polishing.
