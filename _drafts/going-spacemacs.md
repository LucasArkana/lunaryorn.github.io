title: Going Spacemacs
---

In the last few months I was slowly gravitating towards Spacemacs, and about a
month ago I finally couldn’t resist its gravitational pull anymore.  I abandoned
my hand-made, beautiful, elaborate, 3k lines personal Emacs configuration in
favour of Spacemacs, and I’m now going to tell you why I did that, what the
switch was like, and how that whole thing feels.

# Why?

What got me interested in Spacemacs initially was the awesome UI.  More
precisely, the beautiful mode line.  I love beautiful things, and the Spacemacs
UI was just way more beautiful than what I managed to get to with my
configuration.  Even as I write this post in Spacemacs, after more than a month
of using it eight hours a day for my work, I still marvel at its beauty 😍.

A beautiful UI makes me happy, but I must admit that it’s not getting my work
done.  If it had only been the UI it’d have been a short trip to Spacemacs for
me.  And even the beautiful UI didn’t overcome the nagging in the back of my
head which said “Hey, you’re using a starter kit, and you shouldn’t be!”.

## Made from one piece

But soon after installing and starting Spacemacs for the first time I realised
what Spacemacs really is: **It’s not just a starter kit, it’s an editor on its
own!**.  And more than that: It’s a real **product!**, and a great one, too.

Spacemacs doesn’t just tack a bunch of packages together with lots of glue, like
many starter kits do, and like I mostly did in my own configuration.  Spacemacs
*integrates* packages, and every time I use the incredibly consistent key
bindings, browse the perfectly arranged Helm buffers or see the beautiful
UI arrangements I notice that the difference is more than just words.  Spacemacs
appears incredibly consistent and beautiful; it feels like it’s made by a single
genius master mind of design, it feels as if made from one piece.

## Layers

It’s not just the surface that shines:  Spacemacs is well-designed from top
all down the way to it’s internals.  On the surface there are a great UI and a
consistent keybindings.  On the bottom there’s well-thought, powerful and
flexible configuration API which Spacemacs calls “layers”.

Layers successfully overcome a major problem in other starter kits:  The
opaqueness of their configuration.

## VIM bindings

# How did I switch and what was it like?

Slowly.

# What I love!

# What I like less…

# Would I go back again?

No, never.  I don’t know where my Spacemacs journey goes; I’m still at
beginning, slowly porting all my Emacs configuration into my new Spacemacs
layers.  I’ve already a bunch of them, and I even contributed one to Spacemacs,
but there’s still a long way to go.

I don’t know whether I’ll be using Spacemacs “forever”—maybe there will be an
even greater Spacemacs successor some day.  But there’s a thing I know for sure:
I’ll never be able to use bare-bones Emacs again.

Emacs’s dead, long live Spacemacs!

# NOTES:

- Wasn’t smooth, did multiple starts
- layer system hard to get from start up
- Attracted not by Vim bindings, layers, whatnot, but by the “product” and the
  UI

What’s great:

- The “product”
- Embracing VIM
- The layer system
- The community

What’s not so cool:

- Mixed quality… some layers definitely need polishing.
