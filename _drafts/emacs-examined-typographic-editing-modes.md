title: "Emacs Examined: Typographic editing modes"
---

In this post Iâ€™ll introduce you to two modes that bring some typographic editing
features to Emacs: [Typo Mode][] and Tildify Mode.  Typo Mode is a 3rd party
package that helps you insert typographic quotes and punctuation.  Tildify Mode
is a built-in mode in Emacs 25 and upwards that automatically inserts
[non-breaking spaces][nbsp].
