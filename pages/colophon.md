## Tooling ##

This blog is a static website built with pure [Jekyll][] on [Github Pages][].
[html-proofer][] checks the generated site for invalid HTML and other mistakes.

## Style and fonts ##

The serif font on this website is [Vollkorn][] by [Friedrich Althausen][fa].  It
comes with two stylistic sets.  The body text uses the standard, more
“old-style” set.  The headlines use the alternative stylistic set, which gives a
“plainer” look better suited for headlines, but still preserves the consistent
stylistic look of the whole body text.

The sans serif font is [Lato][]; it’s only used for the page title, though.  The
monospace font is [Adobe Source Code Pro][].  It is used for `inline code` and
in source code snippets.  The colour scheme for syntax highlighting of these
snippets is [Solarized Light][].

The great book [Practical Typography][] by [Matthew Butterick][] provided much
help and guidelines for the style of this website.

## Source code, building and deployment ##

I keep the Markdown sources files, HTML templates and CSS stylesheets on
[Github][].  [Github Pages][] automatically builds and deploys the site after
every push.  [Travis CI][] checks and verifies the site independently.
