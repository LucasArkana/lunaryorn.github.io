Hello, I'm Sebastian Wiesner, software developer by occupation and by passion.

I write Scala for a living, and do Haskell for fun and a better world—and a bit
of Rust from time to time.  Before that I wrote Python for almost a decade, and
created Windows GUI applications with WPF and C#.  I’ve also done a bit of
OCaml, and occasionally work on iOS Apps with Swift.  And I use Emacs for
(almost) all of this (except for the Windows stuff).

I maintain a couple of Emacs packages, most notably [Flycheck][] and
[Puppet Mode][], and I write about Emacs, Haskell programming, and various other
things in this blog.

You can find my open source work on [Github][], read my answers on
[Stack Overflow][] and follow me on [Twitter][].
