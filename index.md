> A personal blog about Emacs and functional programming.

Hello, I'm Sebastian Wiesner, software developer by occupation and passion.

These days my passion is Scala, and I’m incredibly happy that I can use Scala
professionally and make a living from my passion.  It’s a great time to live as
a Scala programmer.

Before the beauty and elegance of functional programming was revealed to me,
I was writing Python for almost a decade and made Windows applications with C#
and WPF—which I still believe to be the best GUI framework in the world.
Nowadays my language of choice—besides Scala—is Haskell, but I’ve also done a
bit of OCaml, and occasionally take a curious look at Rust.

My other passion is [Emacs][], the world’s best editor.  I maintain
[Flycheck][], a popular Emacs package for automatic syntax checking.

You can find my open source work on [Github][], read my answers on
[Stack Overflow][] and follow me on [Twitter][].

My GPG key has the ID `5C42FE98` and the fingerprint `5C72 C0D3 CC58 04FF 522E
4815 C4EC 41E3 5C42 FE98`.  You can get it from GPG keyservers or
[download it]({{site.baseurl}}/public-key.txt).  I use this key to sign my
commits on Github.
